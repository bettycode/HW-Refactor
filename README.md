# HW-Refactor

In this project the changes I have applied are as follows:-

. when viewing the source code , you will find semantic HTML elements.

. The image elements have accessible alt attributes.

. You will find concise, descriptive title when viewing the title element.

. The elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.

. Heading attributes fall in sequential order.

. I have added nav,classes and clearfix in the HTML page. By doing that it helped me to arrange the HTML elements semanticly. 

       Changes i made in the CSS file:-


   - For aside lay out i adjected the margins.

   - I commented on the page to make it easy to navigate through.

   - I added border top for the footer and also changed background-color to give it a batter look.
